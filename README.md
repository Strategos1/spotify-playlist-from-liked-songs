Script for creating spotify playlist you can share from liked music

1. You need to copy the script inside your IDE
2. You need to get your client id and client secret from Spotify API

  * First you log in inside https://developer.spotify.com/ with your Spotify credentials
  
  * Then go to a dashboard and create an app. You can fill whatever you wants
  * Example which you can follow:
    * App name: Test
    * App Description: None
    * Website: http://localhost:8888/callback
    * Redirect URI: http://localhost:8888/callback
  * You created it. Go to settings and copy your Client ID and your client secret when you click view client secret
  * You put them inside your script

In script there are comments which tells you exactly what you can change in the script. Don't change anything else if you are not sure what you are doing

Don't share your client id or client secret to anyone you don't know!!!
